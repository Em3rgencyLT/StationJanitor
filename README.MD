# Station Janitor
Windows CLI application for cleaning up save files for game Stationeers.

Currently only has one command to remove objects scattered on the ground.

**I made this for myself, use at your own risk!** (Though it makes a backup of your save!)

## Installation
You can compile it yourself, or download [here](https://github.com/Em3rgencyLT/StationJanitor/releases/download/0.01/StationJanitor.7z).

## Usage
```
./StationJanitor.exe run removeTrash --pathToWorldXml "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Stationeers\saves\YourSaveFolder"
```
